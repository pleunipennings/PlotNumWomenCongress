# PlotNumWomenCongress
Simple python script to plot the number of women in congress over the years in the US

Making a plot of the number of women in the US Congress (House and Senate). 
That jump in 2019 feels good! Makes me optimistic for the future. 
Data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives#Number_of_women_in_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_and_Senate_by_Congress

If anyone has similar data for the number of people of color in congress, I would like to plot that too!
